# Case study 7: Tracer update

Author: Judith Brands and Qian Zhang

## Researcher's voice

This project involves a researcher working at an UMC exploring tracer uptake in patients with cancer (retrospective)
This project will generate: 
  - quantitative parameters on scans 
  - tracer outcome


## Data perspective


### Data collection

In this project, the research team expects to collect the following types of data:

  - pseudonymised data
  - medical history (EPD)
  - Patient characteristics
  - Imaging data


### Ethics perspective

According to the Wet medischp-wetenschappelijke onderzoek met mensen act (WMO), medical research involving humans should be assessed by an accredited METC or a CCMO in advance (before collecting data). **_Question for Judith Brands: Could you check if this explanation is ok? Please add more info about when to choose a METC if possible_**

Since the researcher has double affiliation (the UMC as the first affiliation and the university as the second), it is important to determine the ownership of the data in advance. This can be specified in a contract between the UMC and the university. **_Question for Judith Brands: Judith, is this true? _**
  
  - personal data 
  - ownership
  - METC
  - What DMP? **_Question for Judith Brands: I'm not sure what this means? _**

### Privacy 

  In this project, personal data is going to be processed, therefore, researchers should comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR; the European privacy law). At UT, anyone who processes personal data should register the personal data in a GDPR form which will be checked by the university data protection officer. **_Question for Judith: do researchers have to use informed consent for data collection?_**
  
  - GDPR
  - Privacy and security issues are addressed in the DMP


### Data sharing

  - UT

## Solutions & advices

### Data storage

  - UMC (not University)
  - Security
  - Restricted access
  - Audit at UT?
  - Large amount of data


### Legal 

  - Data archiving (FAIR) 
  - Double affiliation
