# Case study 4 : Master thesis work, interview in a company

Author: Nicolas Dintzner 

## Researcher's voice

A master student is doing an internship within a large consultancy company. The function held by the student involves a number of meetings with employees of that company, as well as meeting with prospective customers, or members of partner organizations. 

The master thesis the student is working on is tightly linked to his professional activities, and involves gathering information from the aforementioned meetings. The student is supervised by both the company and the university where he is carrying out his master study.

The student mostly participates in meetings organized by his company supervisors. He may organize additional ones to gather more specific information from participants. 

<!---Here it would be also nice to mention the aim of this research, the research question of the student.-->

## Data perspective

### Data collection

This study involves collecting interview and panel group information. This may involve audio/video recording, but in this case only meeting notes, minutes, and summaries are produced from the meeting. The data does not need to contain personal information, but the student will have to keep lists of names of the persons he/she talked to during the research. <!---Well such interviews will also include the job title and the affiliation of the interviewees and these are personal information as well. I would mention this.-->

### Ethics perspective

Because the collected information will be in some format made publicly available, the participants should be fully aware that their contribution will be made public. 
However, because everything happens in a professional environment, there are no particular worries regarding the vulnerability of the participants.

### Privacy 

The information collected during the experiment is mostly focused on internal processes and not on sensitive personal information. 

The student is supervised internally, and the company's supervisors will have access to what the student intends to publish. There are therefore little concern regarding the confidentiality of the data itself. 

The anonymity of the participants, promised by the MS student, may be challenging to achieve. The student must pay attention to how he refers to the different participants of the meetings. The company in which he does his internship will be shared in his thesis, and as such, having this information might facilitate identifying the meeting participants. 

### Data sharing

In this instance, it was decided that all personal data collection was to be performed within the company. The student would share anonymized summaries of the meeting notes with their university supervisors, hence limiting personal data transfer. 

Confidential (technical) information <!---What exactly do you mean?--> given to the student by the company was made available to the university supervisor through a corporate solution (suitable for them) <!---What do you mean with suitable to them?-->. 

## Solutions & advices

### Data storage

Given that the student will work most of the time inside the company and that the data used for the thesis is also company documents <!---I don't understand what you mean here. The student will carry out interviews, so I dont understand what do you mean with company documents.-->, the storage solution of the company was deemed sufficient<!---sufficient or suitable? And by whom?-->. 

A storage solution within the university was made available to the student and the company and university supervisors, ensuring that the most relevant information for the MSc thesis work was accessible to all relevant people <!---Who are these relevant people?-->. It was left to the student to ensure that this shared storage contained the right documents. <!---And what documents are these? What is the difference between the documents/data stored on the storage solution of the company? -->

### Legal 

The student's work contract <!---Some more information on this is needed. What does this contract contain?--> can be of use when determining intellectual property rights on the data created during the project. However, in this case, everyone agreed that most of the collected information was going to be confidential (commercially sensitive). 

## Advice (process)

Because the summary of the transcripts <!---This is the first time you mention transcripts. This should be also introduced early in the text under data collection and likely other relevant sections.--> would be published <!---Published where? In the thesis, papers?-->, it is necessary to follow the internal university protocols regarding personal data management. 
Despite participating in meeting organized by the company, the student was requested to create consent forms, informing participants what would happen to the data they provide (public archival), and who would have access to it (both the university _and_ the company supervisor) <!---Who requested this? I don't understand why you start the sentence with 'despite participating in meeting organized by the company'. I don't see the relation of this with the rest of the sentence.-->

In this instance, the most important thing was to ensure that consent was granted for publication of the interview summaries, with approval from the host company. <!---Why is this the most important thing and who decided that this is the most important thing?-->
