# Case study 8: Cyber Security

Author: Santosh Ilamparuthi

## Researcher's voice

Research: Machine learning for cyber security
The project aims to use machine learning to understand and predict malicious actors that try to/succeed in entering a network. For this it is important to analyze recent, representative, realistic, and massive network traffic data using machine learning.
This project will: 
- gather network metadata from all the users on the network
- the data is used to train machine learning system to identify malicious actors


## Data perspective

### Data collection

In this research study the data collection will involve
- Metadata from network traffic, specifically IPs. 
- Longitudinal data collection
- The data is obtained from the university through an external partner who is contracted to provide a service. The external partner provides anonymous data (according to the researchers).  


### Ethics perspective

Ethics approval was required as there are human participants in the study, if only indirectly.
The ethical concerns were about the longterm data collection, the storage and distribution of data and how permission for data collection would be obtained (GDPR concerns).
- Due to the nature of data collection i.e. collecting metadata from the whole network, individual **infromed consent** would not be possible
    - The grounds for precessing that was recommended and used was **"Legitimate Interest"**, this was applicable as the reserach that was carried would be used improve the security of the network and this would be in the interest of the university and the users of the network.
- There would be no sharing of data that is used in the research project and so that was not a concern anymore.
- The researchers didn't really need to store the collected data, it would be used to train the machine learning system and would not be stored longterm, so the data would be stored ad hoc locally on the researchers computers.

### Privacy 

Privacy concerns were with regard to the data provided by the third party contractor and the handling of that data. The contractor stated that the data is **anonymised** and the reserachers think so as well, but the fact that the **data collection is longitudinal** introduces the possiblilty that the when the data is processed in aggregate the users on the network could be identified. 
These concerns were resolved by,
- The data is stored only for a short time 
- While the longitudinal data is collected the machine learning is towards training the system to identify intruders and malicious actors and identifying individual users is not within the research scope and the researchers will not do that. 

### Data sharing

The data collected will not be shared with anyone. The data is not stored for the long term as well. 

### Data storage

The data is stored only long enough for it to be processed. The data is stored only temporarily in local storage on the researchers' computer. Access to the data is only to the members of the research group.  

## Solutions & advice
The data not being shared and the short term data retention addressed most of issues. The main issue tackled was GDPR concerns and this was addressed by using **legitimate interest*
