# Case study 6: Living lab in metropolitan area. 

Author: Yan Wang

## Researcher's voice

The researcher is studying bike theft in the Netherlands. 

In cooperation with a private company, the researcher wants to test a tracking system to uncover where stolen bikes go. 
The outcome is supposed to be used by relevant stakeholders such as local government bodies, or the police forces. 

The protocol involves setting trackers in 100 old bicylces and placing them in areas that are known for bike theft. Then the researchers track the movement of each bikes. 
Conclusion are then drawn from the movement patterns.

The research is then collecting the following information - for each bike: 
- time stamp and current location
- identify potential business places (2nd hand shops)

The process shall continue until tracking devices break down, or run out battery.

## Data perspective

### Data collection

The data collection process involves 24/7 monitoring of the bikes, requiring the appropriate infrastructure. 
The amount of data collected shouldn't be too big (within the range of GB). 

### Ethics perspective

This type of activities implies monitoring human activities without participant's (bike thieves) knowledge of it. This count as "deception", and therefore may require additional review or document for the institutional review board. 

Additionally, this relates to criminal activities, and therefore additional care will be given to such cases.

Despite being indirect witnesses to illegal activities, it was considered that report to the authorities was not necessary as the thieves could not directly be identified. 


### Privacy 

Because of the sensitive nature of the collected data (semi-criminal data), a review by the appropriate privacy team is required. Such study may lead to the redaction of a Data Protection Impact Assesment (DPIA). That process will determine the degree of sensitivity of the information from a GDPR perspective. 

Additionally, since the data is not collected directly by the university, but the partner, a data transfer agreement must be put in place - since, without having much personal detail about bike thieves, we do track their location through several days - and hence, are in a position to re-identify the individual with minimal effort. 

### Data sharing

Data will be shared between the partner and the university. 
The information that will be made publicly available will be aggregated data (meta-level report). Locations will be ``blurred'' in the report. 

## Solutions & advices

### Data storage

The data storage at the university was encrypted and the data transfer was done using specific tools. 

### Legal 

A DPIA was performed as part of the experiment. 

## Advice (process)

Because of the nature of the project (criminal activities and deception), it is advised to go to check with the relevant support teams (ethics and privacy) as soon as possible to ensure minimal delays once the project is started.
