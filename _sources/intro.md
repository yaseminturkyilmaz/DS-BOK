## Naming convention for folders and files ! 

Just to avoid issues, here is how you should name your folders. BE CAREFUL about CAPITALIZATION! 

X_chapter/name-of-the-file.md 

The name of the file mattersis less relevant, but the folders must be in the order in which we want to see them in the table of content! 

Here are some useful links for the redaction process. 

Slides containing the use cases.
