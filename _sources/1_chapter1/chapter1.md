# Case study 1: Living Lab in Katmandu

Author: Yan Wang 

## Researcher's voice

The project aims to create inclusive and resilient dwelling clusters for urban resettlement in Kathmandu (Nepal) and establish a living lab model to develop transparent and integrated methodology of analysis, planning and design. This project will 
- Employ a participatory planning and design approach and survey and map social and spatial living patterns of residents from different urban conditions. 
- Support a new MSc studio: Masters students will carry out field research to the project, as part of their study. 
- Collaborate with practitioners: Research outcome as pilot project for local development

## Data management perspective

### Understanding the data

Various types of data is collected and processed by the research team. Please note that there may be a distinction between the data that will be used for research analysis (research data) and the one that will be for project administration. In this project, the research data includes, for instance, the terrain data (such as drone images, maps, historical land survey and neighbourhood drawings), the interview data (such as the audio recordings, notes from the researchers and the interview transcripts). The informed consent forms, despite the personal data contained, are not research data but require good protection.  

### Ethics perspective

The research team carry out their activities in a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and involves the local community by conducting interviews, taking drone pictures, sketching residential buildings and so on. The target population come from traditional neighborhood, slum and urban resettlement, and include different age groups. There may be a "risk" population, given the social-economic status of some groups and the age of the children and elderly people involved.

Because the research takes place in a foreign country, specific arrangements must be put in place to guarantee that the interviewees can provide an ``informed'' consent - the researchers must inform the participants about the purpose and the procedure of the data processing as well as the participants' rights in language they understand. 

It may be that participants are not able/willing to sign forms, nor provide their names. The procedure for collecting consent should be outlined and reviewed by the appropriate committee. 

### Privacy perspective

The research team collects various types of personal data, such as the locations, household compositions, financial information and health conditions and so on. Therefore sensitive personal data will be collected and processed. The location of the community is in a country outside the EEA. The research data and outcome is shared with the local partners. Special arrangement is needed for such data transfer and protection. 

### Data sharing

All the research data is shared within the project consortium which include international research and industry partners. The research outcome is planned to be shared with the local governmental agencies who will implement the design into concrete construction projects. Students will join the research team in working with the local community and contribute to the research data processing. 

## Solutions & advice
The following has been proposed to the research team to ensure good data management throughout the project lifecycle.

### Data storage and sharing
- Choose a secure storage location that is accessible by external partners. 
- Access control should be designed and implemented to access different types of project data. For instance, limiting the number of partners accessing the sensitive data, separating the storage of the informed consent forms. 
- The interview data is to be collected by the research team, but only aggregated information would be shared beyond the initial core team. 
- Presenting the research outputs in the project website/blog with open and closed communication channel

### Legal perspetive
A few legal issues deserve the attention from the research team:
- The students own their work by default if the idea or creative decision making come from themselves. Therefore it is important to check and clarify the ownership of student design when including them into the project. 
- The project outcome (neighbourhood design) is planned to be transformed into a pilot construction project at the local community. The Intelletcual Property Rights (IPR) of design should be specified in advance and agreed by the project consortium. 

## Advice (process)
- Consult data steward about secure data storage options and data sharing protocols
- Apply ethics approval and prepare informed consent form for conducting the interviews
- Check with privacy advisor for advice on protecting sensitive personal data
- Check with legal advisor and contract manager regarding including student work in research project. If necessary, ask students to agreeing on including their work in research project.
